SaMsaRa Animation and motion analysis library is a portable C++ library which has been designed to offer a consistent framework dedicated to the analysis and synthesis of human motion.

MR provides common methods for motion analysis ( PCA analysis, Time warping, Interpolation ) and straightforward data structures commonly used in animation frameworks (skeletal structures, kinematic chains), SMR provides easy access to forward and inverse kinematics algorithms as well as a collection of functions dedicated to load common animation assets (bvh and asf/amc motion files). SMR is generic (as generic as possible), although a minimal openGL visualization framework is provided, SMR may be integrated into existing rendering frameworks like Horde3D or Panda 3D.
